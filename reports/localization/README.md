# Localization Reports

This directory collects artefacts generated by `tools/update_translations.py`.
Every run produces machine-readable JSON files (`inventory.json`, `status.json`)
and a human-readable `summary.md` that captures catalogue coverage metrics. The
files are regenerated on demand and must not be committed to version control.
The `.gitignore` file ensures the directory stays empty in git except for this
README and `.gitkeep` placeholder.
