# Test and Lint Report — 2025-02-06

## Commands Executed
- `make uv-sync` to refresh the Python 3.13 environment with dev extras.
- `coverage run -m pytest --junitxml=reports/pytest-junit.xml` (via `uv run`) to execute the full test suite with coverage collection.
- `coverage xml -o reports/coverage.xml`, `coverage html -d reports/coverage_html`, and `coverage report -m` to emit coverage artifacts and a summary snapshot saved to `reports/coverage-summary.txt`.
- `uv run ruff check src tests tools` for Python linting.
- `uv run mypy @mypy_targets.txt` for static type checks on the targeted modules.
- `pyside6-qmllint` across `qmllint_targets.txt` to lint the QML surfaces.

## Test Results
- Pytest aborted during collection because Qt runtime libraries (e.g., `libGL.so.1`) are missing; 18 collection errors and 39 Qt-dependent skips were reported. Coverage artifacts were still generated for executed portions before the failure.

## Coverage Highlights
- HDR handling remains lightly covered: `src/ui/main_window_pkg/_hdr_paths.py` (21%) and `src/ui/panels/graphics/hdr_discovery.py` (24%).
- Physics engine modules also have limited coverage: `src/physics/forces.py` (20%), `src/physics/integrator.py` (35%), and `src/physics/odes.py` (35%).

## Linting and Static Analysis
- Ruff: no issues reported; one invalid `# noqa` code noted as a warning only.
- Mypy: targeted modules passed without type errors.
- qmllint: emitted numerous warnings, including missing imports for HDR/IBL/reflection QML components and extensive unqualified access patterns; see `reports/qmllint.log` for the full listing.

## Artifacts
- Pytest JUnit XML: `reports/pytest-junit.xml`
- Coverage summary: `reports/coverage-summary.txt`
- Coverage XML: `reports/coverage.xml`
- Coverage HTML: `reports/coverage_html/index.html`
- Linter outputs: `reports/ruff.log`, `reports/mypy.log`, `reports/qmllint.log`
