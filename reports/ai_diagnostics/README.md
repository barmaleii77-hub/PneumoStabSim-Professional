# AI Diagnostics Artefacts

This directory stores the inputs and outputs generated by `tools/ai_diagnose.py`.
The CI pipeline can upload the files as build artefacts to make investigations
repeatable and auditable.

- `latest_payload.json` — structured bundle of collected logs, code snippets,
  and specification extracts prepared for the LLM session.
- `latest_report.md` — most recent diagnostics report, convenient for quick
  inspection.
- `history/` — timestamped archive of past investigation reports.
- `prompts/` — editable prompt variants.  The CLI writes the default system
  prompt on first run so the team can iterate on wording and share feedback.

When refining the prompts, create a new dated file under `prompts/` and reference
it via the `--system-prompt` option (to be implemented in future extensions).
