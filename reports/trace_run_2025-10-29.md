# Trace-enabled Test Run â€” 2025-10-29

## Environment Preparation
- Installed the full Python toolchain using `make uv-sync`, which materialised the virtual environment with PySide6 6.10.0 and simulation dependencies.
- Executed the application in headless diagnostics mode via `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen python app.py --diag --test-mode --verbose` to trigger tracing hooks and post-run log analysis.

## Run Summary
- The runner configured logging, installed global error hooks, and validated `config/app_settings.json` against the JSON schema before launching the (headless) Qt lifecycle.
- Qt GUI initialisation failed because the container lacks `libGL.so.1`, pushing the app into headless diagnostics mode while still completing the lifecycle and persisting settings.
- Application exited with status code 0 after executing the event loop in test mode and invoking the built-in log diagnostics pipeline.

## Post-run Diagnostics
- Built-in diagnostics reported missing graphics/IBL log directories, as no rendering assets can be produced in headless mode.
- `python analyze_logs.py` reiterated the absence of graphics and IBL traces but confirmed the system log contained only a single warning about the degraded Qt backend.

## Follow-up Recommendations
1. Install Mesa/OpenGL runtime (`libGL.so.1`) in the deployment environment to enable the full Qt Quick 3D UI instead of diagnostics-only mode.
2. Re-run the trace workflow on a machine with GPU support to generate graphics/IBL telemetry for deeper synchronisation metrics.
