# Content Diffs Summary

This report previously tracked merge resolution experiments and accidentally
retained conflict markers.  The history has been squashed into the Git log, so
we keep a brief pointer instead of the 12k-line artifact.  Use `tools/merge_conflict_scan.py`
before committing when regenerating diff audits.
