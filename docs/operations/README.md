## Directory Guide

- `governance.md` – canonical schedule for architecture, sprint, release, and risk review rituals with agendas and escalation paths.
- `risk_register.md` – authoritative list of delivery and operational risks, owners, and mitigation status.
- `onboarding_uv.md` – transcript describing the uv-based environment bootstrap for support teams.

Store supporting artefacts referenced by these guides under `reports/governance/` or the appropriate subdirectory to keep the
knowledge base auditable.
