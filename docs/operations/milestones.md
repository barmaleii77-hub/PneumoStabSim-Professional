# Rolling Milestone Schedule

This document maintains the six-week outlook referenced in the master plan's
Execution Roadmap. It is reviewed during the weekly governance sync alongside
`docs/operations/phase_burndown.md` and the risk register to ensure priorities
stay aligned across teams.

## Update Cadence
- Refresh the table every Friday before the governance sync.
- Link each milestone to supporting evidence (PRs, reports, checklist updates).
- Note owners using role titles to keep responsibility clear even if personnel
  change.
