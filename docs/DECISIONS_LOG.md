# Decisions Log

Keep this log current for all architectural, infrastructure, and delivery process decisions. Each entry should be appended chronologically with the newest items at the top.

| Date (YYYY-MM-DD) | Stakeholders | Context / Problem | Decision | Alternatives Considered | Follow-up Actions |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|----------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| 2025-02-15        | Tech Leads, DevOps, QA | Align coordination cadence with readiness tracking for cross-team blocks. | Introduced weekly readiness syncs with block scoring, GitHub Projects board with epics per readiness stream, and mandated decision log upkeep. | Maintain ad-hoc updates without structured sync; monthly steering only. | Pilot the new sync starting Sprint 18, audit board usage after two iterations. |

> **How to update:** copy the template row, adjust the fields, and ensure follow-ups are reflected in upcoming sync agendas.
