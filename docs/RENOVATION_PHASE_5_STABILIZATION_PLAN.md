# Renovation Phase 5 â€“ Stabilization Plan

## Objectives
- Maintain application quality post-release through monitoring, support, and continuous improvement.
- Institutionalize feedback loops from users, QA, and automated telemetry.
- Keep documentation, training, and maintenance workflows current.

## Entry Criteria
- Release candidate approved and deployed to target distribution channels.
- Support and operations teams onboarded with updated runbooks.
- Telemetry and logging infrastructure validated in staging/production.

## Work Breakdown Structure
1. **Monitoring & Telemetry**
   - Configure centralized log aggregation; define retention and access controls.
   - Set up dashboards tracking crash rates, frame time metrics, and feature usage.
   - Establish on-call rotation and escalation paths documented in `docs/operations/oncall.md`.
2. **Feedback Processing**
   - Run weekly triage sessions for bugs, UX issues, and performance regressions.
   - Maintain prioritized backlog with SLA targets for fixes.
   - Share insights with design/product for roadmap adjustments.
3. **Maintenance & Updates**
   - Schedule monthly dependency reviews (Python packages, Qt patches).
   - Automate security scanning (pip-audit, GitHub Dependabot) and integrate into CI.
   - Document patch release process, including branching strategy and release notes template.
4. **Knowledge Management**
   - Keep MkDocs site versioned; archive outdated guides with changelog references.
   - Host brown-bag sessions for new features and architectural deep dives.
   - Capture learnings in ADRs or postmortem templates stored under `docs/adr/`.

## Deliverables
- Operational dashboards and runbooks published.
- Monthly maintenance calendar with assigned owners.
- Feedback backlog curated and linked to roadmap tracker.

## Exit Criteria
- Incident response metrics (MTTA, MTTR) meeting defined targets for two consecutive months.
- No high-severity issues older than SLA window.
- Documentation and training materials reviewed and signed off quarterly.

## RACI Snapshot
