"""Compatibility package exposing the refactored main window modules.

The original codebase stored the entire main-window implementation in
``src/ui/main_window.py``.  During the ongoing renovation this logic was split
into dedicated modules under :mod:`src.ui.main_window_pkg`.  Some integration
and test utilities, however, still expect the legacy package layout with
``src/ui/main_window/qml_bridge.py`` and related helpers.  This package bridges
that gap by re-exporting the refactored implementation while keeping the public
API surface stable.
