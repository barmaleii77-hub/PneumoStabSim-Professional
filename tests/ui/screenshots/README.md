# UI Screenshot Baseline

This directory stores generated screenshots for the lighting environment tab
checks.  The current update refreshed the tonemapping preset preview slots after
running `pytest tests/ui/test_environment_tab_ibl_dependencies.py`.

> NOTE: Headless CI environments do not capture actual pixels; the pytest run
> records widget states instead.  Keep this placeholder in sync with the
> validation run timestamp documented in the HDR orientation report.
