# PLACEHOLDER: CA certificate for local MITM proxy
#
# This file is intentionally left blank. Do NOT commit real CA certificates to version control.
#
# If you require a CA certificate for local proxying (e.g., for development or testing),
# generate your own and place it here, or configure your environment to load it securely.
#
# See config/certs/README.md and docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md for details.
#
# WARNING: Committing real CA certificates poses a severe security risk.
# Anyone with access to this certificate can intercept TLS traffic from systems that trust it.
# Always use environment-specific certificates and never share production CA keys.
